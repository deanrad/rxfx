<hr>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
So, how often do you deal with cancellation of async operations in your current projects?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
To be honest, not very often. Most of the time, I just let async tasks run their course. If they’re making an API call or something, I assume they’ll finish eventually, and if the user navigates away, it usually doesn’t affect anything too badly.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Hmm, I see. But let me ask you—do you think cancellation is really just an edge case, or could it be more fundamental? Why do you think operating systems have cancellation built into nearly every high-level process?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
I suppose in an operating system, you need to have that control because there are limited resources, and if one process is hogging them, you can shut it down. But for front-end work, we’re not running processes like that. It’s just some API calls here and there.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
True, but what happens if you have a series of large network requests, like file uploads or long API fetches, and the user navigates away or triggers another action? Do you really want those requests hanging around, wasting bandwidth or processing power?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
Well, if the user navigates away, the component gets unmounted, and I assume the request will just resolve eventually. It doesn’t seem like a big deal to me most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
But what if the request keeps running, tying up network resources and maybe even causing unnecessary battery drain on the user’s device? In an environment like a mobile app, where resources are limited, do you think letting tasks run their course could have a negative impact on user experience?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
Hmm, I hadn’t thought about it from that angle. I guess if the user’s on mobile, you’re right—bandwidth and battery life could be a concern.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Exactly. Mobile devices and even modern browsers are designed to conserve resources, and if we don’t cancel tasks that are no longer relevant, we’re wasting those precious resources. Plus, consider this: how many tasks can a device handle at once before the performance starts degrading? Do you think there’s a limit?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
There’s definitely a limit, yeah. If too many things are running, performance will start to suffer. But in a typical React app, I don’t see a ton of async tasks happening at once.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Maybe not in a simple app, but imagine a more complex scenario—like multiple API requests being fired off from different components, or handling large amounts of real-time data. What would happen if none of those requests could be canceled?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
I guess the app could get bogged down with too many requests at once. And I’d have no control over which ones to stop if the user moved to a different part of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Exactly. That’s why cancellation is so important—it gives you control. Not just for performance, but to prevent wasting resources. Have you ever had a situation where an outdated request resulted in stale data being shown to the user?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
Yeah, actually, that’s happened a few times. If two requests finish at different times, the older one can sometimes overwrite the newer data. It’s annoying to debug.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
That’s a direct result of not being able to cancel. Imagine if, when the new request started, you could just cancel the previous one. No more stale data. Does that sound like something that could make your code more reliable?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
Definitely. Cancelling the outdated request would stop that problem from happening in the first place. So, I guess cancellation isn’t just about performance, but also about making sure the app behaves correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Exactly. And think about how cancellation ties into the user’s expectations. If they click a button and it triggers a request, they expect the most recent action to be what matters, right? Would you want the app responding to their <em>old</em> action instead of their latest?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
No, of course not. That would make it feel slow or unresponsive, like the app’s not keeping up with what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Right. Now, let me ask you—if cancellation is built into operating systems to manage resources and prioritize what’s most important, don’t you think the same should apply to the web? After all, a web app is just another system with processes that need managing. Wouldn’t handling resources carefully be just as important?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
Yeah, that makes sense. We do have limited resources—bandwidth, memory, battery—and just letting tasks run wild could affect performance. I hadn’t really considered that before.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Exactly. And here’s another thought: when you&#x27;re handling resources on a user&#x27;s device, like making network requests or interacting with storage, do you think it’s respectful of the user’s device to leave requests running that are no longer relevant?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
No, it’s not. If we’re running things in the background that the user doesn’t need anymore, that’s wasteful. It could drain their battery or slow down other parts of the app.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Right. So now, do you still think cancellation is just an edge case, or do you see it as more of a fundamental necessity for responsible app development?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
I’m starting to see it’s more fundamental. It’s not just about a few rare cases—it’s about making sure the app uses resources responsibly and keeps up with what the user is doing. Cancellation seems like something I should be handling a lot more often than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Exactly. Cancellation isn’t just for the rare edge case—it’s crucial for ensuring that your app is performant, responsive, and respectful of the resources it’s consuming. Would you say that making cancellation a default part of your async handling could improve the quality of your code?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
Yeah, I think it could. I’ll need to start thinking about it as a fundamental part of my async logic, not just something to handle occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Great! You’re thinking about it the right way now. So, what do you think your next steps would be to implement better cancellation handling in your projects?</p>
<p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> :
I think I’ll start by using tools like <code>RxFx</code> to handle cancellation more gracefully, making sure that when a new request comes in, I can cancel the old one. I’ll also pay more attention to how resources are being used, especially on mobile devices. It’s time to make cancellation a key part of my async handling.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> :
Exactly! Sounds like you&#x27;re ready to take control of your async processes like a pro.</p></article></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/rxfx/docs/intro/">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/rxfx/blog/">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 My Project, Inc.
