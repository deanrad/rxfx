# ùó•ùòÖùëìùë• `effect`

A Vanilla JS container for Effect Management, based on RxJS. Supports cancelation, concurrency modes (queueing, throttling, debouncing), and TypeScript.

Part of the [ùó•ùòÖùëìùë•](https://github.com/deanrad/rxfx) family of libraries.

# What Is It Good For?

When you have an async effect, embodied in a function that returns a Promise or an Observable, but you want it to:

- not run too often
- be cancelable
- automatically track whether it is active

# Usage

Treat `createEffect` (or a concurrency-controlled version like `createQueueingEffect`) as a higher-order function which returns a concurrency-controlled, cancelable version of that function

```
npm i -S @rxfx/effect
```

```ts
import { createEffect, createQueueingEffect } from '@rxfx/effect';

const ringBell = () => {
  /* returns a Promise for when a bell has completed ringing */
};

// The RxFx effect with no concurrency control
const ringEffect = createEffect(ringBell);
// An RxFx effect that queues ringing, with the same API as createEffect
const queuedRing = createQueueingEffect(ringBell);

queuedRing(); // ring it now
queuedRing(); // ring after the first
queuedRing.request(); // alternate way to ring

queuedRing.cancelCurrent();          // cancels this ring, begins the next 
queuedRing.cancelCurrentAndQueued(); // cancels this ring, empties the queue

// Query if active now, or subscribe to all activity updates
queuedRing.isActive.value
queuedRing.isActive.subscribe

// The current error (cleared when a new execution begins), or all errors
queuedRing.currentError.value
queuedRing.errors.subscribe

// See @rxfx/service for more
```

# Usage in React

The `useService` hook from `@rxfx/react` brings the current `isActive` status and `currentError` into React.

```ts
function BellComponent() {
  const { isActive, currentError } = useService(queuedRing);
  // render üõéÔ∏è if active
}
```

# Usage in Angular

```ts
import { queuedRing } from '../services/ringer'

export class BellComponent {
  isActive$: Observable<boolean>;

  constructor() {
    this.isActive$ = queuedRing.isActive;
  }

  ring() {
    queuedRing();
  }

}

// html
<button (click)="ring()">
<div>busy: {{ isActive$ | async }}</div>

```


# Relation to `@rxfx/bus` and `@rxfx/service`
Every effect returned by `createEffect` or its variants is an instance of an `@rxfx/service`. You might use `@rxfx/effect` when you only care about the effect in a concurrency-controlled and cancelable fashion, and are not tracking its state.


Compared to creating a service, when you create an effect, you omit the parameters `name`, `bus`, and `reducer`, so RxFx fills them in as shown:

- Name: A randomly assigned ID
- Bus: The `defaultBus` as exposed by `@rxfx/service`
- Reducer: A default reducer whose state is always the most recent response (though if you are interested in state, you probably are using `createService` not `createEffect`)

All the effect's lifecycle events (`request`, `started`, `next`, `complete`, `error`, `cancel`, `canceled`) go on its bus, and can be logged to the console with `bus.spy`, though the names of the events will have the random name assigned:

```
// bus.spy(({type}) => console.log(type));
aed123/request
aed123/next
aed123/complete
```

If `bus.reset()` is called, all existing effects will stop responding to requests, and if their executions are cancelable, those will be canceled too.

# Errors

If the effect function returns a rejected Promise, throws an exception, or returns an Observable which emits an error, there is no risk to your app as a whole. The error goes onto the bus as a regular event, and you can respond to them or log them via the `.errors` Observable.

```ts
// See errors in the console
queuedRing.errors.subscribe(console.error)
```

# Cancelability
Since Promises are not generally cancelable, the primary way to create a cancelable effect is to make it from a function that returns an Observable.

Otherwise, if your effect's Promise can abort on an `AbortSignal`, use `makeAbortableHandler` in `@rxfx/ajax`. [Specs](https://github.com/deanrad/rxfx/blob/main/ajax/test/makeAbortableHandler.spec.ts)

# Concurrency Modes

Race conditions are easily prevented when code is set to run in the correct Concurrency Mode for its use case. With ùó•ùòÖùëìùë•, its easily named and tested modes (which use RxJS operators underneath) allow you to keep your code readable, and you can eliminate race conditions in a 1-line code diff.

The modes, pictorially represented here with use cases and descriptions, are utilized just by calling `createEffect`, `createQueueingEffect`, `createSwitchingEffect`, or `createBlockingEffect` accordingly. Your effect stays the same, only the concurrency is different.

Choose your mode by answering this question:

_If the effect is running, and a new request arrives, should we:_

- Begin the new effect at once, allowing both to finish in any order. (`createEffect`)
- Begin the new effect only after any currently running effects, preserving order. (`createQueueingEffect`)
- Prevent/throttle the new effect from beginning. (`createBlockingEffect`)
- Cancel the currently running effect and begin the new effect at once. (`createSwitchingEffect`)

And one final mode, seldom used, but included for completion:

- Cancel the currently running effect, and don't begin a new effect. (`createTogglingEffect`)

Here are representations of each mode:

# Comparison: RxFx vs RxJS

To implement a queued bell ringer with raw RxJS you'd trigger it from a `Subject`, create an `Observable` with a pipe, and call `subscribe` on it:

```ts
import { Subject } from 'rxjs'
import { concatMap } from 'rxjs/operators'

const ringer = new Subject();
ringer.pipe(
  concatMap(ringBell)
).subscribe();

ringer.next() // immediate 1st ring
ringer.next() // queued 2nd ring
```

But this would not allow cancelation of the current ring! To add cancelation you need more imports and another `Subject`

```ts
import { Subject } from 'rxjs'
import { concatMap, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators'

const cancels = new Subject();
const ringer = new Subject();

const bellEffect = ringer.pipe(
  concatMap(() => {
    return defer(ring).pipe(
      takeUntil(cancels)
    )
  })
).subscribe()

ringer.next() // immediate 1st ring
ringer.next() // queued 2nd ring
```

So it works, but the happy path is very obscured, and it would take quite a lot of mastery of RxJS to read or write that code. (Also this version doesn't even handle `cancelCurrentAndQueued`).

In short ‚Äî while you _could_ use raw RxJS, all the awkwardness of it goes away when you use an ùó•ùòÖùëìùë• service or an effect.

- No calls to `subscribe`
- Fewer imports
- No awkward `pipe`s.

So stop fighting the tools, and climb up a level of abstraction - it's nice up here!
