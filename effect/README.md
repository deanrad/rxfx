# ùó•ùòÖùëìùë• `effect`
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-brightgreen)

A Vanilla JS container for Effect Management, based on RxJS. Supports cancelation, concurrency modes (queueing, throttling, debouncing), and TypeScript.

Part of the [ùó•ùòÖùëìùë•](https://github.com/deanrad/rxfx) family of libraries.

# What Is It Good For?

When you have an async effect, embodied in a function that returns a Promise or an Observable, but you want it to:

- not run too often
- be cancelable
- automatically track whether it is active

# Usage

Treat `createEffect` (or a concurrency-controlled version like `createQueueingEffect`) as a higher-order function which returns a concurrency-controlled, cancelable version of that function

```
npm i -S @rxfx/effect
```

```ts
import { createEffect, createQueueingEffect } from '@rxfx/effect';

const ringBell = () => {
  /* returns a Promise or Observable for playing a bell sound */
};

// The RxFx effect with no concurrency control
const ringEffect = createEffect(ringBell);
// An RxFx effect that queues ringing, with the same API as createEffect
const queuedRing = createQueueingEffect(ringBell);

queuedRing(); // ring it now
queuedRing(); // ring after the first
queuedRing.request(); // alternate way to ring

queuedRing.cancelCurrent(); // cancels this ring, begins the next
queuedRing.cancelCurrentAndQueued(); // cancels this ring, empties the queue

// Query if active now, or subscribe to all activity updates
queuedRing.isActive.value;
queuedRing.isActive.subscribe(fn)

// The current error, or all errors
queuedRing.currentError.value;
queuedRing.errors.subscribe(fn);
```

- Play with the [React CodeSandbox.](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/rxfx-bell-effect-1-1-zk6289)

# Usage in React

The `useService` hook from `@rxfx/react` brings the current `isActive` status and `currentError` into React.

```ts
function BellComponent() {
  const { isActive, currentError } = useService(queuedRing);
  // render üõéÔ∏è if active
}
```

# Usage in Angular

```ts
import { queuedRing } from '../services/ringer'

export class BellComponent {
  isActive$: Observable<boolean>;

  constructor() {
    this.isActive$ = queuedRing.isActive;
  }

  ring() {
    queuedRing();
  }

}

// html
<button (click)="ring()">
<div>busy: {{ isActive$ | async }}</div>

```

# Errors

If the effect function returns a rejected Promise, throws an exception, or returns an Observable which emits an error, there is no risk to your app as a whole. The error goes onto `.errors`, and you can respond to them or log them via the `.errors` Observable.

```ts
// See errors in the console
queuedRing.errors.subscribe(console.error);
```

The most recent error is on the `currentError` property, which can be checked via
`queuedRing.currentError.value`. In React, the `useService` hook returns a live-updating `currentError` value for rendering. See [@rxfx/react](https://github.com/deanrad/rxfx/tree/main/react) for more details on the `useService` hook.

# Cancelability

Since Promises are not generally cancelable, the primary way to create a cancelable effect is to make it from a function that returns an Observable.

```ts
import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';

const userFetcher = createEffect((id) => {
  return ajax.getJSON({ url: 'http://...' + id });
});

userFetcher(1); // starts a fetch
userFetcher.cancelCurrent(); // cancels it
```

Otherwise, if your effect's Promise can abort on an `AbortSignal`, use `makeAbortableHandler` in `@rxfx/ajax`.

```ts
import { makeAbortableHandler } from '@rxfx/ajax';

const cancelableFetch = (cat, signal) => {
  return fetch('http://cat.pet?t=500' + cat, { signal });
};

const userFetcher = createEffect(makeAbortableHandler(cancelableFetch));

userFetcher(1); // starts a fetch
userFetcher.cancelCurrent(); // cancels it
```

If running in Queued mode, `cancelCurrent()` will cancel the current, and immediately begin executing the next queued effect handling. If you want to cancel with the entire queue, use `cancelCurrentAndQueued()`.

For an even more complete cancelation, call `shutdown()` on an EffectRunner, which will cancel all AND stop handling new events.

```
userFetcher.shutdown()
```

Finally, the strongest cancelation, allows every effect to be shutdown at the same time, like for program termination, using `shutdownAll()`.

```ts
import { shutdownAll } from '@rxfx/effect';

// To cancel all and stop listening to future effects.
shutdownAll();
```

# Concurrency Modes

Race conditions are easily prevented when code is set to run in the correct Concurrency Mode for its use case. With ùó•ùòÖùëìùë•, its easily named and tested modes (which use RxJS operators underneath) allow you to keep your code readable, and you can eliminate race conditions in a 1-line code diff.

The modes, pictorially represented here with use cases and descriptions, are utilized just by calling `createEffect`, `createQueueingEffect`, `createSwitchingEffect`, or `createBlockingEffect` accordingly. Your effect stays the same, only the concurrency is different.

Choose your mode by answering this question:

_If the effect is running, and a new request arrives, should we:_

- Begin the new effect at once, allowing both to finish in any order. (`createEffect`)
- Begin the new effect only after any currently running effects, preserving order. (`createQueueingEffect`)
- Prevent/throttle the new effect from beginning. (`createBlockingEffect`)
- Cancel the currently running effect and begin the new effect at once. (`createSwitchingEffect`)

And one final mode, seldom used, but included for completion:

- Cancel the currently running effect, and don't begin a new effect. (`createTogglingEffect`)

Here are representations of each mode:

# Comparison: RxFx vs RxJS

To implement a queued bell ringer with raw RxJS you'd trigger it from a `Subject`, create an `Observable` with a pipe, and call `subscribe` on it:

```ts
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { concatMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

const ringer = new Subject();
ringer.pipe(concatMap(ringBell)).subscribe(fn);

ringer.next(); // immediate 1st ring
ringer.next(); // queued 2nd ring
```

But this would not allow cancelation of the current ring! To add cancelation you need more imports and another `Subject`

```ts
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { concatMap, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';

const cancels = new Subject();
const ringer = new Subject();

const bellEffect = ringer
  .pipe(
    concatMap(() => {
      return defer(ring).pipe(takeUntil(cancels));
    })
  )
  .subscribe();

ringer.next(); // immediate 1st ring
ringer.next(); // queued 2nd ring
```

And to be able to cancel the whole queue:

```ts
const ringer = new Subject<void>();
const cancels = new Subject<void>();
const restartEntireQueue = new Subject<void>();

restartEntireQueue
  .pipe(
    switchMap(() =>
      ringer.pipe(
        concatMap(() =>
          defer(playBellWebAudio).pipe(
            // Allow single-cancelation
            takeUntil(cancels)
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
  .subscribe();

ringer.next(); // Add ring to the queue
cancels.next(); // Cancel the current ring playing
restartEntireQueue.next(); // Cancels the current, and queued
```

So it works, but the happy path is very obscured, and it would take quite a lot of mastery of RxJS to read or write that code.
In short ‚Äî while you _could_ use raw RxJS, all the awkwardness of it goes away when you use an ùó•ùòÖùëìùë• service or an effect.

- No calls to `subscribe`
- Fewer imports
- No awkward `pipe`s.

For comparison, the RxFx is just:

```ts
import { createEffect } from '@rxfx/effect';
const bellRinger = createQueueingEffect(playBellWebAudio);

bellRinger.cancelCurrent(); // cancels one
bellRinger.cancelCurrentAndQueued(); // also empties the queue
```

So stop fighting the tools, and climb up a level of abstraction - it's nice up here!
